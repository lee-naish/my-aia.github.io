# Dijkstra's Algorithm
---

Dijkstra's algorithm is a method used in computer science to find the shortest path between points on a map or a network. Imagine you're trying to find the quickest way from one place to another, considering the distances between places. Here's how Dijkstra's algorithm works:

Start: You begin at a chosen point (like a city on a map) and call it your starting point. You're at this point, so the distance from it to itself is 0.

Explore: You look at the places directly connected to your current point (like neighboring cities). You figure out how far they are from your starting point.

Update: For each of these connected places, you see if the distance to reach them through your current point is shorter than the distance you knew before. If it's shorter, you update the distance.

Move: You then pick the nearest unexplored place as your new current point and repeat steps 2 and 3.

Keep Going: You keep doing this until you reach your destination or you've checked all possible paths.

Done: Once you've reached your destination, you can trace back the path you took to get there using the shortest distances you found.

The algorithm is smart because it always chooses the shortest path at each step. It's useful for finding efficient routes, like when your GPS figures out the fastest way to get somewhere by considering the roads' lengths.

Remember, Dijkstra's algorithm works best when distances between points are positive (no negative values). It's a helpful tool for solving real-world problems where you want to find the quickest way between things.
